## Biome Distribution

#### Surface Generation

The worldgen has been reimplemented entirely via Snowcapped to fine-tune the biome distribution as well as to avoid general Terrablender / other biome injection mod jank.

#### Cave Generation

Cave biomes spawn wherever they can, meaning that there are virtually no "boring caves". A surface biome's climate, elevation, and how in-land it is defines what cave biomes spawn beneath. Sandy caves spawn underneath desert biomes, crystal caves generate under warm and humid biomes, biomes from Alex's Caves generate under mountains of various temperatures, ect ect.

## Structure Generation

#### Villages

Villages and the functionality of villagers has been removed. Finding a village early game trivializes aspects of survival such as getting food and shelter, and provides less incentive for players to build their own shelters or sources of food. In fact, all structures that could serve as free food and shelter have been removed.

Villagers have been removed in the sense that they can no longer be traded with, but are still "obtainable" through various methods. Wandering traders have been removed.

#### UDaS

UDaS is the primary structure mod in this modpack, as most structures from Vanilla or other mods have been removed. It is a combination of IDaS, Integrated Stronghold, and Integrated Cataclysm, forked to rely on other dependencies and modified to fit the modpack. It serves to provide combat challenges in a way that's integrated with the modpack as a whole.

## Ores

#### Distribution

Since villagers were removed, so were emeralds. Coal has also been removed.
#### Glowing

By default, an optional glowing ores resource pack is activated in this modpack. It serves to make caving easier by having ores more visible without needing to turn on fullbright. It can be disabled at any time through the resource pack menu.
