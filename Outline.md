# Introduction

Antiderivative is a broadly-themed pack with aspects of magic, exploration, tech, and combat. It focuses on creating an integrated experience between the core mods through overhauled recipes, progression, and other custom content. While Antiderivative is by no means a "vanilla+ modpack", it aims to replicate and enhance the most enjoyable aspects of Vanilla Minecraft to the furthest degrees possible, which I believe to be exploration, automation, and progression. Most mods have been reimplemented from the ground up, so don't expect a similar experience to how they work/progress normally!

# Exploration / Worldgen

Antiderivative has a variety of biome mods, the biggest ones being Alex's Caves, Atmospheric, Galosphere, and Regions Unexplored (?). The biome distribution is completely custom, however, a prime example being caves from Alex's Caves spawn frequently in the Overworld and Nether. Ore generation has also been reworked, with some ores like Coal or Emerald removed, and the rest of the ores having their distribution shifted around.

In addition to custom biome and ore generation, it also features a structure mod made specifically for the modpack; Unintegrated Dungeons and Structures, or UDaS for short. It's a fork of [IDaS](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/idas) with both the dependencies and some of the structures themselves changed to fit the modpack better, as many features from Supplementaries, Quark, and Create don't fit in this pack. Extra care has been put into both the placement and distribution of said structures. 

# Combat / Gear Progression

Apotheosis is the main source of power to the player in the pack, with other sources of power either being changed to be centered around it (enchanting in the form of applying gems to gear) or being heavily complimented by it (guns from Scorched Guns). Other mods, such as TiCon, serve to provide more utility to gear/the player. Since Apotheosis is the main source of power, mobs spawned when the player has highly affixed gear will become more chaotic and unique, such as zombies spawning with the ability to cast spells from Iron's Spells and Spellbooks, or charged creepers riding phantoms. To compensate for the increased difficulty when wearing affixed gear, these unique mobs will have special drops, as well as there being higher quality loot from chests.

# Tech

The tech in this pack primarily revolves around Crossroads, Botania, and Actually Additions (?), with complimentary mods like TiCon, Scorched Guns, and a stripped-down version of AE2, focused mainly on storage rather than automation. Rather than using traditional machine chaining, automation and processing are focused on in-world interaction puzzles.

Tech progression is designed to be non-linear and entirely optionalâ€”players can experience everything the pack offers without engaging in the tech/automation aspects. Instead of being a requirement, technology serves as a tool to enhance and expand upon what players can already do, providing more opportunities and efficiency, much like Vanilla Minecraft.

# Comforts / QoL

There are a variety of cozy and QoL mods included, such as Excessive Building and Architect's Palette for building blocks, Farmer's Delight + its many addons for food, Hexalia for witchery, Building Gadgets for, well, Building Gadgets, and Refurbished Furniture for furniture.
