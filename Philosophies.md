- Grind-free - Steps in progression are reasonably spaced from one another
- Integration - Mods are meant to be used in conjunction with each other rather than being standalone experiences
- Intuitive - Mechanics are to be straightforward and self-explanatory, with guides to help ease the player into them
- Balanced - Mechanics are implemented to serve different niches and not overpower or undermine each other
- Forgiving - Players are only punished for death in the form of XP loss and gear durability loss, all equipment stays with you
- Unobtrusive - No mobs spawn on the surface, and the player has to actively look for danger
